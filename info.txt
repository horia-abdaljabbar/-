 
"this"-----> will refer to the context in which the function is called if we use an arrow function (the arrow function cannot binding this),
 or this will refer to the context in which this is called if we are using a function expression(the expression function can binding this).
 If we use a function expression we can use this instead of event.target.

"this" with arrow function: it will log the window - [object Window] and search in it.

"this" with function expression:it will log the element that i wanted it to log in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"event.target"-----> Refers to the element that initiated the event. we can use it in both arrow function and function expression.
